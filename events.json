We are here with the 13th Psychology Days organized by Istanbul University Psychology Club, with the theme 'Mysticism'. ✨\n\nAs humans questioning existence, they have begun to ask more questions about who they are in the face of a changing world. They delved into the depths of consciousness and embarked on mystical paths. At times, they felt inner peace, at times turmoil. The answers they found raised new questions. Some resorted to facts, while others used traditional methods. Our speakers, who will guide us like a compass on this journey, will shed light on questions related to mysticism through modern psychology.\n\nOur event will take place on May 4-5, 2024, at the Ord. Prof. Dr. Cemil Bilsel Conference Hall. 🤍\n\n❗Our event is free and open to everyone.\n\n❗The doors will open at 09:15 for our event."

It aims to treat personality disorders and other psychiatric disorders that do not respond to other treatment options. As it is known, resolving characterological problems with classical cognitive-behavioral therapy is quite challenging. In Schema Therapy, the goal is to identify early maladaptive schemas stemming from unmet basic needs in early childhood and raise awareness in the patient about them. Treatment approaches in Schema Therapy often progress not through schemas themselves but through the 'mode concept,' which involves the combination of activated schemas and coping styles."
