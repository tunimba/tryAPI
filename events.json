            "description": "The brief solution-focused approach consists of a set of special techniques that therapists and counselors use during the counseling process. These techniques help the client focus on their strengths and moments when the problem is not experienced and are supported by various tasks and exercises. The approach is based on the perspective that 'Problems are experienced, solutions are found' and takes momentum from the client to achieve change. The client is encouraged to try ways they have never tried before in solving the problem, remember periods when the problem was manageable, and positive aspects are revealed to achieve change and contribute to sustaining this change. The focus is on the 'Here and Now,' not the past and future.\n\n* Only psychology and psychological counseling and guidance students and graduates can participate in our programs.\n\n* Supervision is planned as a single day outside of the program days. A 3-hour supervision session will be held with the participants 2 weeks after the training."
