            "description": "Everything speaks in its own language;\n\nEven if darkness covers it\n\nIt continues in the night, in various colors\n\nOn the tree branch, in the wind;\n\nEverything speaks in its own color.\n\nCan Yücel, Green Poem\n\nWe are organizing this event for undergraduate psychology students and newly graduated psychology enthusiasts. Our aim is to bring together young individuals at the beginning of their journey with those who have dedicated years to various disciplines of psychology. Thus, we want to connect young psychologists or candidates who are seeking their own path with different role models and create an active interaction environment where emotions, thoughts, and experiences are shared...\n\nWhere did the idea of 'Colorful Psychology' come from? Let's explain by quoting from the text I wrote while introducing the Psychology Department on Okan University's Psychology Department website: Imagine for a moment that you want to paint a wall in your house. Needless to say, before obtaining your color, you need to make some preparations to color the wall. First, you must repair and prime the wall. Then, with the right information, you mentally prepare the color, quality, and suitability of the actual coloring you will apply in multiple layers. Undergraduate education in psychology is like this initial stage to achieve the desired outcome and establish a solid foundation. Your color choice occurs as a final step that reflects your desire and goal. Let's continue with our coloring analogy. There are so many colors to choose from that each one can open the doors to a different world for you...\n\nWe couldn't cover all the colors in this first meeting. There are many more colors to come. Let's get started. We are waiting for all students. See you soon..\n\nProf. Dr. Arif Haldun SOYGÜR"
