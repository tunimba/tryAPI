This requires active inhibition of distractions, making the test more challenging and advancing its decisive qualities.\n\nMOXO Child Test\nThe MOXO Child Test is specifically designed for children aged 6-12 and serves as an auxiliary tool for ADHD diagnosis and patient observation processes for professionals. It is a short and online test containing various stimuli and distractors.\n\nA 15-minute online test with age-appropriate stimuli\nVarious languages audio instructions and a trial session easily understandable by children\nA unique set of distractors that allows testing of an individual's performance under different environmental conditions\nAn up-to-date norm base covering ages 6 and up\nA performance graph that measures the change in an individual's performance over time (during the test)\nAn online interface easily accessible from any computer with internet access using only a keyboard, without any additional devices\nPatient information secured with high-level security according to USA-HIPPA privacy laws and regulations\n\nMOXO Adolescent & Adult Test\nThe MOXO Adolescent&Adult test covers the age range of 13-65 and assists professionals in evaluating the attention profile of patients in ADHD diagnosis and observation processes. The MOXO Adolescent&Adult ADHD Test models the environmental conditions an individual faces in daily life with its unique distraction system.\n\nAn 18-minute online test with appropriate stimuli and distractors\nA unique set of distractors that allows testing of an individual's performance under different environmental conditions\nA regularly updated norm base consisting of a total of 900 individuals from different countries\nA performance graph that measures the change in an individual's performance over time (during the test)\nAn online interface easily accessible from any computer with internet access using only a keyboard, without any additional devices\nPatient information secured with high-level security according to USA-HIPPA privacy laws and regulations\n\nWho Can Attend the Training?\nThe training is intended for Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Psychological Counselors, Special Education Specialists, and senior students of related fields.\n\nDocument to be Awarded at the End of Training\nA MOXO Practitioner Expert Certificate will be awarded.\n\nQuota\nLimited.\n\nPlatform Where the Training Will Take Place\nGoogle Meet\n\nTraining Fee\n2000 TL."

Our aim is to bring together young individuals at the beginning of their journey with those who have dedicated years to various disciplines of psychology. Thus, we want to connect young psychologists or candidates who are seeking their own path with different role models and create an active interaction environment where emotions, thoughts, and experiences are shared...\n\nWhere did the idea of 'Colorful Psychology' come from? Let's explain by quoting from the text I wrote while introducing the Psychology Department on Okan University's Psychology Department website: Imagine for a moment that you want to paint a wall in your house. Needless to say, before obtaining your color, you need to make some preparations to color the wall. First, you must repair and prime the wall. Then, with the right information, you mentally prepare the color, quality, and suitability of the actual coloring you will apply in multiple layers. Undergraduate education in psychology is like this initial stage to achieve the desired outcome and establish a solid foundation. Your color choice occurs as a final step that reflects your desire and goal. Let's continue with our coloring analogy. There are so many colors to choose from that each one can open the doors to a different world for you...\n\nWe couldn't cover all the colors in this first meeting. There are many more colors to come. Let's get started. We are waiting for all students. See you soon..\n\nProf. Dr. Arif Haldun SOYG√úR"
