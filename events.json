    "description": "Dasein, meaning existence. The term was introduced to the public with Heidegger's book 'Being and Time'. In his philosophy, Dasein has existed in a certain way. It is the mode of existence of human individuals. Perhaps you too have found yourself questioning your life, your goals, yourself, the geography you live in, or your relationships from time to time. What is the meaning of all this, who am I, why do all these people behave this way, what am I doing here? Perhaps, at the most fundamental level, you are searching for the meaning of your existence in the infinite universe; you are not alone. We invite you to Dasein to ask all these questions and more together and search for their answers with your whole existence. Will you join us?\n\nNon-formal Education Trainers\nBetül Şimşek\nBüşranur Portakal\nEzgi Kılıç\nİrem Özden\n\nTrainings to be provided\n\nEigenwelt: The part of existence that belongs to my self. What have you filled the concept of 'I' with, what adjectives have you used, or have you left it empty, sometimes not even wanting to approach it? No matter what, you define yourself best.\n\nMitwelt: Everything about being close to someone else, establishing relationships, positioning oneself in that relationship, or conflict; essentially everything related to relating.\n\nUmwelt: You are in contact with everything, and everything is in contact with you. What is everything? Look up and around you; everything you think affects you, even what you are not aware of.\n\nUberwelt: Just as the universe consists of thousands of parts, does our existence also consist of parts? Which part suits me, which one do I not want? Am I looking for perfection?\n\n🗓Date: May 25-26, 2024\n📍Venue: Kaira Psychology / Bakırköy\n📌Saturday hours: 10.00-18.00\n📌Sunday hours: 10.00-18.00\n📌Participation is limited.\n📌Fee: 140 TL\n(The fee is for two days.

It aims to treat personality disorders and other psychiatric disorders that do not respond to other treatment options. It is known that characterological problems are difficult to solve with classical cognitive-behavioral therapy. Schema Therapy aims to identify early maladaptive schemas that arise due to unmet basic needs in early childhood and to raise awareness in the patient. In Schema Therapy, treatment approaches mostly progress not through schemas, but through the 'mode concept', which is considered a combination of active schemas and their coping styles."
