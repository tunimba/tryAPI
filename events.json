Prof. Dr. Itır Tarı Cömert's 20 years of CBT experience. It offers participants not only the theoretical transmission of CBT's fundamental concepts and techniques but also practical applications, including how these techniques are used by therapists, how formulation is done, supplemented with example session videos, role-plays, supervision-supported review sessions, and case analyses.\n\nProgram Operation\nIn each module of the program, alongside the theoretical presentation, participants are shown example session videos by Assoc. Prof. Dr. Itır Tarı Cömert, followed by experiencing the therapy process through role-plays. Instead of a passive learning process, participants engage in an active learning experience by taking on the roles of both therapist and client. At the end of each module, a detailed discussion is conducted on how to approach a case specific to that module, how questions are asked, and a general summary of the module is provided. Additionally, supervision-supported review sessions are held outside of the training days at the end of each module. These sessions aim for the internalization of the module by the participants through reviews, role-plays, and case analyses."
