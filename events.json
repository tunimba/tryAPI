      "description": "The short-term solution-focused approach consists of special techniques that therapists and counselors use in the counseling process. These techniques help the client focus on moments when the problem does not occur and on their strengths, supported by various assignments and activities. With the perspective of 'Problems occur, solutions are found,' the change is achieved by taking momentum from the client. The client is encouraged to try methods they have never tried before in solving the problem, recall periods when the problem was manageable, and thus achieve change. Positive aspects are highlighted to foster change, which is then sustained through developmental contributions. The focus is on the concepts of Now and Here, not on the past and future.\n\n*Only psychology and psychological counseling and guidance students and graduates can participate in our programs.\n\n*Supervision is planned as a single day outside of the program days. A 3-hour supervision will be conducted with the participants 2 weeks after the training."
