Thus, we, POEM and Psychotherapy Turkey, have designed a series of trainings called 'The Therapist's Toolkit.'\n\nThis program aims to provide participants with theoretical knowledge about various techniques that can be used in psychotherapy practice, equip them with skills on how these techniques can be practically applied, and support them in gaining experience about the therapy room through example applications."

This requires active inhibition of distractions, making the test more challenging and advancing its decisive qualities.\n\nMOXO Child Test\nThe MOXO Child Test is specifically designed for children aged 6-12 and serves as an auxiliary tool for ADHD diagnosis and patient observation processes for professionals. It is a short and online test containing various stimuli and distractors.\n\nA 15-minute online test with age-appropriate stimuli\nVarious languages audio instructions and a trial session easily understandable by children\nA unique set of distractors that allows testing of an individual's performance under different environmental conditions\nAn up-to-date norm base covering ages 6 and up\nA performance graph that measures the change in an individual's performance over time (during the test)\nAn online interface easily accessible from any computer with internet access using only a keyboard, without any additional devices\nPatient information secured with high-level security according to USA-HIPPA privacy laws and regulations\n\nMOXO Adolescent & Adult Test\nThe MOXO Adolescent&Adult test covers the age range of 13-65 and assists professionals in evaluating the attention profile of patients in ADHD diagnosis and observation processes.
