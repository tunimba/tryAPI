            "description": "In our psychotherapy practice, regardless of which map we use, there are fundamental techniques that guide us in therapy. These are the techniques that enrich a therapist's toolkit, develop the therapist, and provide flexibility.\n\nResponding to the demands from our students and graduates, we recognized the need for such a training package. Thus, we, POEM and Psychotherapy Turkey, have designed a series of trainings called 'The Therapist's Toolkit.'\n\nThis program aims to provide participants with theoretical knowledge about various techniques that can be used in psychotherapy practice, equip them with skills on how these techniques can be practically applied, and support them in gaining experience about the therapy room through example applications."

This requires active inhibition of distractions, making the test more challenging and advancing its decisive qualities.\n\nMOXO Child Test\nThe MOXO Child Test is specifically designed for children aged 6-12 and serves as an auxiliary tool for ADHD diagnosis and patient observation processes for professionals. It is a short and online test containing various stimuli and distractors.\n\nA 15-minute online test with age-appropriate stimuli\nVarious languages audio instructions and a trial session easily understandable by children\nA unique set of distractors that allows testing of an individual's performance under different environmental conditions\nAn up-to-date norm base covering ages 6 and up\nA performance graph that measures the change in an individual's performance over time (during the test)\nAn online interface easily accessible from any computer with internet access using only a keyboard, without any additional devices\nPatient information secured with high-level security according to USA-HIPPA privacy laws and regulations\n\nMOXO Adolescent & Adult Test\nThe MOXO Adolescent&Adult test covers the age range of 13-65 and assists professionals in evaluating the attention profile of patients in ADHD diagnosis and observation processes. The MOXO Adolescent&Adult ADHD Test models the environmental conditions an individual faces in daily life with its unique distraction system.\n\nAn 18-minute online test with appropriate stimuli and distractors\nA unique set of distractors that allows testing of an individual's performance under different environmental conditions\nA regularly updated norm base consisting of a total of 900 individuals from different countries\nA performance graph that measures the change in an individual's performance over time (during the test)\nAn online interface easily accessible from any computer with internet access using only a keyboard, without any additional devices\nPatient information secured with high-level security according to USA-HIPPA privacy laws and regulations\n\nWho Can Attend the Training?\nThe training is intended for Psychologists, Psychiatrists, Psychological Counselors, Special Education Specialists, and senior students of related fields.\n\nDocument to be Awarded at the End of Training\nA MOXO Practitioner Expert Certificate will be awarded.\n\nQuota\nLimited.\n\nPlatform Where the Training Will Take Place\nGoogle Meet\n\nTraining Fee\n2000 TL."
