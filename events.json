This requires active inhibition of distractions, making the test more challenging and advancing its decisive qualities.\n\nMOXO Child Test\nThe MOXO Child Test is specifically designed for children aged 6-12 and serves as an auxiliary tool for ADHD diagnosis and patient observation processes for professionals. It is a short and online test containing various stimuli and distractors.\n\nA 15-minute online test with age-appropriate stimuli\nVarious languages audio instructions and a trial session easily understandable by children\nA unique set of distractors that allows testing of an individual's performance under different environmental conditions\nAn up-to-date norm base covering ages 6 and up\nA performance graph that measures the change in an individual's performance over time (during the test)\nAn online interface easily accessible from any computer with internet access using only a keyboard, without any additional devices\nPatient information secured with high-level security according to USA-HIPPA privacy laws and regulations\n\nMOXO Adolescent & Adult Test\nThe MOXO Adolescent&Adult test covers the age range of 13-65 and assists professionals in evaluating the attention profile of patients in ADHD diagnosis and observation processes.
