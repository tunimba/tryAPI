It aims to treat personality disorders and other psychiatric disorders that do not respond to other treatment options. As it is known, resolving characterological problems with classical cognitive-behavioral therapy is quite challenging. In Schema Therapy, the goal is to identify early maladaptive schemas stemming from unmet basic needs in early childhood and raise awareness in the patient about them. Treatment approaches in Schema Therapy often progress not through schemas themselves but through the 'mode concept,' which involves the combination of activated schemas and coping styles."
