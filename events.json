            "description": "Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) is a heterogeneous psychiatric disorder characterized by individuals avoiding certain foods or food categories due to increased sensitivity to sensory characteristics (e.g., taste, texture, appearance, smell) of food and/or restricting intake in quantity. One of the most common reasons for avoidance and restriction in ARFID is increased sensitivity to sensory characteristics of food. Individuals diagnosed with ARFID may also avoid or restrict food due to fear of unwanted outcomes such as choking, vomiting, or gastrointestinal pain. These individuals often experience a trauma related to food and then begin to avoid certain foods to protect themselves from another adverse experience. Individuals with ARFID also often show a lack of interest in food or eating and may maintain a limited diet in terms of quantity. Those with lack of interest describe eating as a chore, and this is often reflected in a low appetite.\n\nPsychological therapies are prominent in the treatment of ARFID. A cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT-AR) has been developed for ARFID. This therapy includes three optional modules that the therapist can apply depending on the patient’s primary maintenance mechanism. This therapy can be applied in an individual format or with family support, depending on the patient's age, and can last 20-30 sessions depending on the severity of the eating disorder. This training will address ARFID treatment from a psychotherapeutic perspective.\n\nThis program consists of 4 sessions and a total of 8 hours."
